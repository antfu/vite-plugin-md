title: Typescript code block without a Language
---

# Code Builder Test

this test is intended to validate testing of code blocks; below is a code block with
no language stated:

```
## Hey Ho
this is a test
```

But we might also run into cases where there is no language but we have attributes we
want to set on the block.

``` { class: 'foobar' }
## Stylish
Impressive ... markdown with foobar styling
```

The test is now complete; everyone should return to their desks.
