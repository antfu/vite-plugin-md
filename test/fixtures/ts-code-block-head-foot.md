# Code Builder Test

this test is intended to validate testing of code blocks

```ts heading="This is a code block", footer="lovely right?"
type Valid = 'foo' | 'bar' | 'baz'
const testVariable: Valid = 'foo'
function myFunc(name: string) {
  return `hello ${name}`
}
```

The test is now complete; everyone should return to their desks.
