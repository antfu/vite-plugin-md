# External Referencing with CSV

```#ts filename="./foo/code.ts", heading="Using CSV format", highlight=2
```

When referencing external code it's not uncommon to want to annotate something about it and while the `heading` and `footer` are the most common means of doing this ... you can also add content _into_ the code block and this code will be added ABOVE the code which is imported.

> Note: highlighting will use the imported code as the beginning of the line numbers, whereas the inline code will have negative line numbers
